# TCS-Phase-1-Simply-Blogging
  Project for TCS Simplilearn Phase 1. Develop a blog for a company where people can post articles and customers can benefit the content. To complete this project I created 4 html pages then I tried to add css to the html using the version of bootstrap that I already had on my computer (v3.0.02). Then I created a script file to add articles to the block page. However I ran into issues regarding both the css and the javascript. My html files didn't seem to recognize the that the link to the css was there thus I forced to add the css directly to the html files in order to actually see anything. A similar issue occured with the javascript file. However, I was unable to fix it despite my best efforts though comparing my code to what others have done the logic should be fine.
